It completely depends on how knowledgeable you are.. If I may suggest you a project.. It may look silly to you or a big load of heavy task in front of you just for a mini project if you are not clear about anything.

First know your ups and downs. On which field you are strong on.

Second calculate how much time you can spend on it.


Third clearly understand the requirements and get into it. Do not fuzz up in the end. Setup clear goals

Work hard to complete it. If you are struck somewhere there are hell lot of people to help you with. Your friends,teachers, stack overflow and GOOGLE.
don't try to copy any codes. Jus take the overall idea and work on it. After all you are doing it for learning purpose

And lastly if you are taking up a project. You shouldn't leave it in half way that's more important.

Assuming that you are a beginner and have some knowledge on coding, I LL suggest you few

Do a shopping website a full functional with Java j2ee patterns if u can. And make the website responsive

Try doing a snake and ladder game with C graphics. (if u don't know C graphics learn it. Belive me the understandings from it may help big in your future) and why I am suggesting you snake and ladder is.. You might have to work on your math's and logical part for drawing the snake and ladder dynamically.

Try taking up a college project something that your college might need to do automation.

If you would lik to have a steep learning curve. Try creating something like artificial intelligence with open nlp and open cyc.

Try doing mobile applications which ever is your favorite platform.

Create a desktop application in Java swing or using c# and implement a business logic to it.

Or if you are smart enough to get a project from any small companies or shops through your networks. You get the logic from them and also you get money for it after completing your product. That's a double dhamaka, a project to your resume and money to your pocket.
